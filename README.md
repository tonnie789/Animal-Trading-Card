# Animal-Trading-Card
During my Udacity Nanodegree course I had to develop an animal trading card as part of my CSS module assessment, below were the requirements:

Design

- The text is italicized for the animal’s interesting fact.

- The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items.

- The dots are removed from the animal's list items.

- Uses border around animal’s name, image, and information (interesting fact, list items, and description).

- Uses border around animal’s information.

- Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information.

- Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side. 

- Card should not expand with the browser window).


Custom Image and Text

- The placeholder image and information is replaced with favorite animal image and information.

- The image is 300px wide or the image's width is set to 300px.

- The image’s alt is relevant to the animal used.

CRITERIA

- CSS Classes

- The HTML includes classes that are used for styling.

- Classes are given meaningful names.

- Separation of Concerns

- Student separates HTML from CSS by linking to stylesheet.

- HTML code does not include <style> elements or style attributes in the body.

Code Quality

- Code is ready for review, meaning new lines and indentation are used for easy readability.
