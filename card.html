        <p class="intro">The lion is the second largest cat in the world (behind tigers), they are the most social of all big cats and live together in groups called “prides.” The average pride consists of five or six females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males who mate with the adult females.</p>

         <p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. Lions have terrific night vision, their eyes are 6 times more sensitive to light than humans which gives them a distinct advantage over some prey species when hunting at night. The average male lion weighs around 180 kg (400 lb) while the average female lion weighs around 130 kg (290 lb) and they can reach speeds of up to 81kph (50 mph) but only in short bursts because of lack of stamina.
